This repository provides the full script for an imaginary video rental website
where the staff can add movies along with all their attributes such as cost, title, year etc...
and where users can choose and filter the movies by those attributes.. using the django framework to create and synch models with a database using the django migration file.
The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with all the Django framework, it is heavily commented.
