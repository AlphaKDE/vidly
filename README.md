This repository provides the full script for an imaginary video rental website
where the staff can add movies along with their attributes such as cost, title, year etc...
and where users can visit the site and locate the movies available, with their cost, title,genre etc...I am using the django framework to create and synch models with a database using the django migration file.

The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with the entirety of the Django framework, it is heavily commented.
